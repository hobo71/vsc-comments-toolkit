![Comments Toolkit Logo](comments-toolkit-logo.png)

Comments Toolkit provides comments auto-completions (snippets) for

`<!-- HTML code comments -->`

`/* C+ style comments */`

Comment-Snippets has been widely inspired by [Sublime Text's Comment-Snippets plugin](https://github.com/hachesilva/Comment-Snippets) from *hachesilva*
